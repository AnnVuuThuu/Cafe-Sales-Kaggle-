# Cafe-Sales-Kaggle-

What I do:
- Pick a messy dataset from Kaggle’s “dirty data” datasets.
- Clean it using Pandas (handling NaN, duplicates, formats):
  + Handle Missing Values:
    Fill missing numeric values with back fill or forward fill.
    Replace missing categorical values with the mode or "Unknown."
  + Handle Invalid Values:
    Replace invalid entries like "ERROR" and "UNKNOWN" with NaN or appropriate values.
  + Date Consistency:
    Ensure all dates are in a consistent format.
    Fill missing dates with plausible values based on nearby records.
  + Feature Engineering:
    Create new columns, such as Day of the Week or Transaction Month, for further analysis.
- Do exploratory data analysis (EDA) and summarize trends.
